# Contributing to Rune

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Rune, which is hosted in the [RuneKit Organization](https://github.com/runekit-oss) on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Rune Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [rune-maintainers@example.com](mailto:rune-maintainers@example.com).

## What should I know before I get started?

### Rune Structure

Rune is a monorepo structured as follows:

```
rune/
├── packages/
│   ├── core/         # SHARED OFFLINE LOGIC (TypeScript)
│   ├── cli/          # Node.js CLI Tool (consumes `core`)
│   ├── web/          # React Web App (consumes `core`)
│   └── desktop/      # Tauri Native App (consumes `core`)
├── docker/           # Docker configs for self-hosting the web app
```

The `core` package contains all the shared business logic that is used across all platforms. When adding new features, consider whether they should be implemented in `core` or in the platform-specific packages.

### Design Decisions

When we make a significant decision in how we maintain the project and what we can or cannot support, we will document it in the [Rune Design Decisions](docs/design-decisions.md) file. If you have a question around how we do things, check to see if it is documented there. If not, please open an issue and ask!

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Rune. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). Fill out [the required template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* **Check the [documentation](README.md)** for a list of common questions and problems.
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/runekit-oss/runekit/issues)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined [which repository](#rune-structure) your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in [the template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples.
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
* **If you're reporting that Loki crashed**, include a crash report with a stack trace from the operating system.
* **If the problem is related to performance or memory**, include a [CPU profile capture](https://github.com/runekit-oss/runekit/blob/main/docs/profiling.md) with your report.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of Loki) or was this always a problem?
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which version of Loki are you using?**
* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using?**
* **Are you running Loki in a virtual machine?** If so, which VM software are you using and which operating systems and versions are used for the host and the guest?

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Loki, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check [this list](#before-submitting-an-enhancement-suggestion) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion). Fill in [the template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md), including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

* **Check the [documentation](README.md)** for a list of common questions and problems.
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/runekit-oss/runekit/issues)** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined [which repository](#rune-structure) your enhancement suggestion is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part of Loki which the suggestion is related to.
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Loki users.
* **List some other tools or applications where this enhancement exists.**
* **Specify which version of Loki you're using.**
* **Specify the name and version of the OS you're using.**

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Loki? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Beginner issues][beginner] - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Help wanted issues][help-wanted] - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain Loki's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible Loki
- Enable a sustainable system for Loki's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in [the template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing <details><summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.</details>

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

## Additional Notes

### Issue and Pull Request Labels

This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests.

[GitHub search](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) makes it easy to use labels for finding groups of issues or pull requests you're interested in.

The labels are loosely grouped by their purpose, but it's not required that every issue have a label from every group or that an issue can't have more than one label from the same group.

Please open an issue on `runekit-oss/runekit` if you have suggestions for new labels, and if you notice some labels are missing on some repositories, then please open an issue on that repository.
