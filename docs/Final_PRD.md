Of course. This definitive PRD synthesizes all our decisions into a final, comprehensive blueprint. It merges the multi-platform architecture and distribution strategy of the `Vikas` plan with the `rune` branding and feature set, while incorporating your specific requirements for a CLI-first development cycle, rigorous testing, and security.

This document is structured to be given directly to an AI coding assistant to generate the best possible project.

# **PRD: Loki - The Offline Developer Suite**

  * **Version:** 1.0 (Final for Initial Build)
  * **Date:** August 8, 2025
  * **Status:** Ready for Development

## **1. Vision & Objective**

To create **`rune`**, a comprehensive, open-source developer tool suite designed to streamline common development tasks across multiple platforms. Built with **privacy-first principles**, all processing happens 100% locally on the user's machine, with absolutely no data transmitted to external servers.

Our goal is to build a thriving open-source community around a high-quality, essential tool that developers can trust and rely on for their daily workflows.

-----

## **2. Core Value Proposition & Platform Strategy**

  * **Privacy-First:** All processing happens locally. No network requests, no data leaves your device.
  * **Multi-Platform:** A cohesive experience across a Web app, CLI tool, Native Desktop app, and Docker containers.
  * **Code Reuse:** A single TypeScript `core` library powers all platforms, ensuring consistency and maintainability.
  * **Open Source:** MIT licensed and driven by community contributions.

### **Platform Strategy**

| Platform | Technology Stack | Use Case | Distribution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CLI Tool** | **Node.js/TypeScript** | Automation, scripting, CI/CD | `npm`, Homebrew, etc. |
| **Web App** | **React/TypeScript** | Quick browser access, no install | Vercel, Docker, Self-hosted |
| **Native App**| **Tauri (Rust/TS)**| Deep system integration, local files| GitHub Releases |
| **Docker**| **Nginx/Alpine** | Self-hosting the web app for teams | Docker Hub, GHCR |

-----

## **3. Monorepo Architecture**

The project will be structured as a TypeScript-focused monorepo to maximize code sharing between the CLI, Web, and Desktop applications. The CLI will be built using a modern framework like `oclif` or `commander.js`.

## **4. Development & Release Process**

The development timeline will prioritize the CLI to serve power users first, followed by the highly accessible web application and other platforms.

#### **Phase 1: CLI Tool & Core Logic (Weeks 1-5)**

  * **Week 1-2: Foundation.** Setup the monorepo, the `core` package with its initial utilities (formatters, decoders), and the basic CLI structure.
  * **Week 3-5: Full CLI Implementation.** Build out all specified CLI commands, ensuring they are robust, well-documented, and thoroughly tested. Prepare the package for publication on `npm`.

#### **Phase 2: Web Application (Weeks 6-9)**

  * **Week 6-7: UI Development.** Build the React web application, consuming the shared `packages/core` for all functionalities.
  * **Week 8-9: Deployment & Containerization.** Configure deployment to Vercel. Build and test the Docker images for self-hosting.

#### **Phase 3: Desktop App & Community Growth (Weeks 10-12)**

  * **Week 10-11:** Build the Tauri native app, wrapping the web UI.
  * **Week 12:** Finalize all documentation, create contribution guides, and release v1.0.0.

## **5. Detailed Feature Specifications (CLI)**

The CLI is the heart of the power-user experience. All commands must support reading from `stdin` if a primary argument is not provided.

  * **`rune jwt decode [TOKEN]`**: Decodes a JWT token and prints its header and payload as formatted JSON.
  * **`rune saml decode [SAML_RESPONSE]`**: Decodes a Base64-encoded SAML Response into human-readable, formatted XML.
  * **`rune json format [JSON_DATA]`**: Pretty-prints a JSON string or file. Accepts an `--indent <int>` option (default: 2).
  * **`rune xml format [XML_DATA]`**: Pretty-prints an XML string or file.
  * **`rune yaml format [YAML_DATA]`**: Parses and outputs a clean, well-formatted YAML string.
  * **`rune csv to-json [CSV_DATA]`**: Converts CSV data into a JSON array of objects.
  * **`rune json to-csv [JSON_DATA]`**: Converts a JSON array of flat objects into CSV data. The keys of the first object in the array will be the CSV headers.

-----

## **6. Git Repository Setup**

The repository must be professionally configured from the start.

  * **`README.md`:** A detailed README including the "Why Loki?" story:
    > ### **Why Loki?**
    > Is it because this tool is a mischievous shapeshifter, masterfully transforming your data from one form to another—turning chaotic JSON into structured CSV, or decoding cryptic tokens into readable text?
    > Or is it just a simple shorthand for a **Lo**cal **Ki**t of developer tools?
    > The answer is yes.
  * **`LICENSE`:** MIT License.
  * **`.gitignore`:** A standard Node.js/TypeScript template.
  * **Contribution Guide:** A `CONTRIBUTING.md` file explaining how to set up the development environment and contribute code.

-----

## **7. Quality Assurance & Testing Strategy**

A rigorous testing process is non-negotiable to ensure reliability and user trust.

  * **Unit Testing:** Every function in `packages/core` and every command in `packages/cli` must have comprehensive unit tests. Code coverage targets should be set to \>90%.
  * **Required Test Case Scenarios:** Every feature must be tested against the following scenarios:
    1.  **Happy Path:** Testing the feature with valid, expected input from both direct arguments and `stdin`.
    2.  **Malformed Input:** Providing invalid data (e.g., broken JSON, incorrect JWT format) must be handled gracefully with clear error messages printed to `stderr` and a non-zero exit code. **The application must never crash.**
    3.  **Edge Cases:** Testing with empty files, single-line files, data containing special Unicode characters, and other unusual but valid inputs.
    4.  **Boundary Conditions:** Testing with very large files (\>100MB) to check for performance and memory usage, particularly for formatters and converters.

## **8. Security Hardening Requirements**

Security and user trust are paramount for a developer tool.

  * **No External Network Requests:** The application code **must not** contain any external network calls. This must be a core, enforced principle to guarantee the privacy-first promise. This can be verified in CI with network sandboxing.
  * **Dependency Security:** The CI/CD pipeline must include a step to run `npm audit --audit-level=high` to continuously monitor third-party libraries for known vulnerabilities and fail the build if high-severity issues are found.
  * **Secure Parsing:** All data parsers (especially for complex formats like XML) must be implemented using battle-tested libraries that are hardened against exploits like Billion Laughs Attack (XML) or prototype pollution (JSON).
  * **Container Security:** The Docker image for the self-hosted web app will be built from a minimal Alpine base, run as a non-root user, and be regularly scanned for vulnerabilities using tools like Trivy in the CI pipeline.
